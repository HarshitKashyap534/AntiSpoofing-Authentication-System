# Anti-Spoofing Authentication System

The Anti-Spoofing Authentication System (ASAS) is a cutting-edge AI-powered software designed to enhance security measures by accurately detecting spoofed or morphed images during authentication processes. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, ASAS provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that the images used in authentication scenarios are genuine and have not been tampered with. This software is ideal for integration into various security-sensitive systems like access control, online identity verification, and any system requiring robust authentication methods.

## Features

- **Spoof Detection:** Quickly identifies whether an image has been digitally altered or spoofed.
- **Morph Detection:** Detects morphed images, ensuring that the face or object in the image has not been manipulated to mimic another individual or object.
- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes state-of-the-art AI models trained on extensive datasets to ensure high accuracy in spoof and morph detection.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed to be easily integrated with existing authentication workflows and systems.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Capable of performing analysis in real-time for seamless authentication processes.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. Follow these steps to install ASAS:
